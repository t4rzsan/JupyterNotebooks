    "A type is a way to tell F# how you want to shape your data.  Data can be anything, including integers, decimals or text strings.  F# has a lot of built-in typs such as `string`, `int` and `decimal` and it also has container types like `array`, `list` and `seq` (sequence) that can contain other items.  You have already seen some of the built-in F# types and you have also created some types of your own in the first example, where you created the `PersonPolicy` type.\n",
