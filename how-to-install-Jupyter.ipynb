    "# How to setup Jupyter\n",
    "This notebook describes how to install Jupyter Notebook on a Windows box.  The Jupyter is flaky so this is an attempt to put it all together in one place.\n",

    "# Installing Jupyter\n",
    "The easiest way too install Jupyter is through Anaconda.  Go to the Anaconda [download page](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "After Anaconda has been installed, start Anaconda Navigator and launch Jupyter from there.  This will open a browser for an address similiar to http://localhost:8888 which shows you the home location of Jupyter on your system.  From here you can start new notebooks or edit existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Change the Jupyter startup folder\n",
    "By default Jupyter starts from the C:\\ root and it seems there is no way to go to another drive.  If you want Jupyter to start from another location, type the following into a cmd prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "    jupyter notebook --generate-config\n",
    "\n",
    "This will generate a Jupyter config file for you.  Open the file in a text editor and change the line\n",
    "    #c.NotebookApp.notebook_dir = ''\n",
    "to\n",
    "    #c.NotebookApp.notebook_dir = 'd:\\my-directory'\n",
    "    \n",
    "It seems that Jupyter sometimes ignores the startup directory.  Alternatively you may start Jupyter Notebook in any given directory from the command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "    jupyter notebook --notebook-dir=d:\\my-directory\n"

    "## Code in text\n",
    "If you want to show code with syntax highlighting in your text (as opposed to kernel code that you with to run), you can use three back ticks (\\`\\`\\`).  You may also specify a language for syntax highlighting.\n",

    "## Static images\n",
    "If you want to display images in your notebook, put the images in a subfolder next to your .ypnb file.  Include them in markdown by using the HTML &lt;img> tag.  In the 'src' attribute _always_ prepend 'files' to the folder path if you are using relative paths, i.e. \n",

    "## Hiding code blocks in Jupyter\n",
    "You may want to hide your R or Python code blocks when distributing your Jupyter Notebooks to someone else.  This shows you a way to do this when exporting your notebook as HTML or showing your notebook in [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by adding a \"Raw NBConvert\" block at the top of your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paste the following JavaScript and HTML into the block (shamelessly stolen from [elsewhere](http://chris-said.io/2016/02/13/how-to-make-polished-jupyter-presentations-with-optional-code-visibility/)).\n",
